# Introduction

From the moment you set foot on the Isle of Steem, people have been telling you to be careful. Things aren't behaving. Something is  wrong with the Block Chain. 

Docile creatures are attacking anything that moves. 
People scared and confused.  

For years, the witnesses have been silent.  

The pleas of the common folk remain unanswered. What is the cause of this corruption, and how will the world mend?

Are you the hero that will save Steem?
